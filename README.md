# Reco
The proposed system work develops a personalized system, where the user's current emotion is analyzed with the help of the chat bot. The chat bot identifies the user's sentiment by chat conversation with the user. Based on the input provided by the user, currentemotion or mood is analyzed by the chat bot and it will suggest song to the user. The objective of our application is to identify the mood expressed by the user and once the mood is identified, songs are played by the application. The application solves the basic needs of music listeners without troubling them as existing applications do.
